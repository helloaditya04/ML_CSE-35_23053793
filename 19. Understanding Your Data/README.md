<h2>Data Quality and Ethical Considerations in Data Science</h2>

<p>High-quality data is the cornerstone of any data science project. To extract actionable insights, it is essential to source the right data and perform thorough cleaning and preprocessing.</p>

<h2>Understanding Your Data</h2>

<p>The foundational step in data analysis is understanding your data. This involves exploring its characteristics, identifying patterns, and examining relationships to uncover meaningful insights.</p>

<h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>

<p>At the outset of a project, it is crucial to consider potential harms that your tools might cause. These can arise from:</p>

<ul><li>Designing solutions for only a narrow user group</li>
  <li>Insufficient representation of sub-populations</li>
  <li>Biases introduced by human labelers favoring privileged groups</li></ul>

<h2>Bias in Machine Learning</h2>

<p>Machine learning models generalize patterns in the data, which means they can also replicate existing biases. Under-represented groups may provide fewer examples for the model to learn from, leading to reduced accuracy and fairness for those individuals.</p>

<p>When deployed at scale, biased models can result in widespread negative impacts. Therefore, always evaluate risks carefully and implement strategies to mitigate bias and ensure fairness.</p>
