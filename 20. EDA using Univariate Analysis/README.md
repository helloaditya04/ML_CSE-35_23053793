# Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis is the simplest form of data analysis where you examine only one variable at a time. The word "uni" means one, so univariate means we're looking at a single variable in isolation — understanding its distribution, central tendency, spread, and shape.


Unlike bivariate or multivariate analysis, univariate analysis does not look at relationships or causes. Its sole purpose is to describe and summarize a single variable.


Univariate analysis is always the first step in any data science project. Before comparing variables or building models, you need to thoroughly understand each variable on its own — its range, typical values, outliers, and distribution shape. It lays the foundation for all further analysis.
