# What is Feature Engineering ?

Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to create, transform, or select input variables (features) that make machine learning models more accurate and efficient.
In simple terms: it's about preparing and improving your raw data so that ML algorithms can learn from it better.

# Why It Matters

Raw data is rarely in the perfect format for a model. Feature engineering bridges the gap between raw data and a well-performing model. A good feature can often matter more than the choice of algorithm.

# Summary

Good features = Better models. Feature engineering is often the most impactful step in the ML pipeline — more so than tuning hyperparameters or switching algorithms.

It requires domain knowledge + creativity + experimentation to do wel
